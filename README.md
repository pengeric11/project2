# Project 2
Create your project here! Make sure to follow the instructions on Canvas regarding getting set up (i.e., creating a `development` branch), and submitting your project.

The included **jest tests** allow you to test the validity of your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. It assumes that your files names are `index.html`, `js/index.js`, and `css/style.css`. To test your validity, simply run:

```bash
# Install packages for testing
npm install

# Test code validity
jest
```
